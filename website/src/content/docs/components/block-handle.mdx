title: Block Handle

import Demo from '@/components/ui/demo/demo.astro';

Block handle components enable users to interact with, reorder, and insert blocks in your editor through drag-and-drop operations.

<Demo story="block-handle" />

## Overview

The block handle system provides two main capabilities:
- **Block manipulation**: Add new blocks or drag existing blocks to reorder content
- **Visual feedback**: Show users exactly where content will be placed during drag operations

## Components

### Block Handle

The `BlockHandle` consists of three main components:

- **`BlockHandlePopover`**: A popover container that appears on the left side when hovering over a block
- **`BlockHandleAdd`**: An add button (+) that inserts a new block below the current one
- **`BlockHandleDraggable`**: A drag handle (⋮⋮) that allows users to reorder blocks by dragging

You can use `BlockHandleAdd`, `BlockHandleDraggable`, or both together depending on your needs.

### Drop Indicator

The `DropIndicator` provides visual feedback during drag-and-drop operations by showing a horizontal line where the dragged content will be inserted. It automatically appears when dragging and disappears when the drag operation completes.

## Installation

Copy and paste the component source files linked above into your project.
