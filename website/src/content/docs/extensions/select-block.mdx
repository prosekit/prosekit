title: Select Block
---

import Demo from '@/components/ui/demo/demo.astro';

The `select-block` extension provides a command and keyboard shortcut to select the current block. When pressing `Ctrl-A` (or `Cmd-A` on Mac), it first selects the current block, and if the block is already selected, it selects the entire document.

<Demo story="select-block" />

## Usage

```ts twoslash
import { defineSelectBlock } from 'prosekit/extensions/select-block'

const extension = defineSelectBlock()
```

## Commands

### `selectBlock`

Selects the current block. The extension intelligently determines which block to select:

- If the cursor is in a text block (paragraph, heading), it selects that block
- If the cursor is in a container block (blockquote, list), it selects the container block
- If the selection spans multiple blocks, it selects all the blocks from the first to the last

```ts twoslash
import { createEditor } from 'prosekit/core'
import { defineSelectBlock } from 'prosekit/extensions/select-block'

const extension = defineSelectBlock()
const editor = createEditor({ extension })

// ---cut---
editor.commands.selectBlock()
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Non-Apple | Apple   | Description                                                             |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl-A`  | `Cmd-A` | First press: select current block. Second press: select entire document |

## Behavior

The `selectBlock` command and `Ctrl-A` shortcut have the following behavior:

1. **First press**: Selects the current block
   - If the cursor is in a paragraph, it selects the paragraph
   - If the cursor is in a heading, it selects the heading
   - If the cursor is in a blockquote, it selects the entire blockquote
   - If the cursor is in a list, it selects the entire list
   - If the selection spans multiple blocks, it selects all blocks from first to last

2. **Second press** (when block is already selected): Selects the entire document

3. **When already all selected**: Does nothing (keeps the all selection)

## Examples

### Selecting a Paragraph

When the cursor is in a paragraph, pressing `Ctrl-A` selects the entire paragraph.

### Selecting a Blockquote

When the cursor is inside a blockquote, pressing `Ctrl-A` selects the entire blockquote container, not just the paragraph inside it.

### Selecting a List

When the cursor is inside a list item, pressing `Ctrl-A` selects the entire list container.

### Selecting Multiple Blocks

When the selection spans multiple blocks (e.g., from the middle of one paragraph to the middle of another), pressing `Ctrl-A` selects all blocks from the first to the last.
