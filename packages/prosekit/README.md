# prosekit

This package provides a convenient way to install all the `@prosekit` scoped packages at once. This saves you from having to install each package individually.

For example, the following two imports are equivalent:

```js
import { defineItalic } from 'prosekit/extensions/italic'
```

```js
import { defineItalic } from '@prosekit/extension-italic'
```
