# Styling

## Apply your own style

ProseKit is headless, giving you full control over your editor's appearance. However, to help you in getting started, we offers two basic stylesheets.

```ts twoslash
import 'prosekit/basic/style.css'
```

```ts twoslash
import 'prosekit/basic/typography.css'
```

The `prosekit/basic/style.css` file provides essential styles to ensure the editor displays correctly.

The `prosekit/basic/typography.css` file offers basic typography styles for the editor, like margins, paddings, and font sizes. This is optional, and you can exclude it if you wish to use your own styles.
