You can render your document.

1. You can create a non-editable editor. This approach maximally preserves your content. However, since ProseKit is a browser-side library, you cannot use this method to render your document on the server side. Please refer to the readonly extension.

2. You can use `editor.getDocHTML()` to output an HTML string. This format supports server-side rendering and is SEO-friendly.
