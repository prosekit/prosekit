`defineCodeBlockShiki()` now sets two CSS variables `--prosemirror-highlight`
and `--prosemirror-highlight-bg` on the code block elements, representing the
text color and background color of the code block respectively. These colors are
based on the Shiki theme you pass to `defineCodeBlockShiki()`.

`prosekit/basic/typography.css` is also updated to use these CSS variables to
set the text color and background color of code blocks.
