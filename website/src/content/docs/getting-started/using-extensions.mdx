Extensions are at the heart of ProseKit's flexibility and power. They allow you to add functionality to your editor in a modular way, making it easy to build exactly the editing experience you need.

## What are extensions?

Extensions in ProseKit are modular pieces of functionality that you can add to your editor. They can provide:

- **Nodes** (paragraphs, headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)
- **Marks** (bold, italic, underline, etc.)
- **Commands** (functions that modify the document)
- **Keyboard shortcuts**
- **Input rules** (automatic transformations as you type)
- **Custom behaviors** and much more

## Basic extension usage

ProseKit provides a `defineBasicExtension()` function that includes common editing features like paragraphs, headings, and basic text formatting:

```ts
import {
  createEditor,
  defineBasicExtension,
} from 'prosekit/core'

// Create a basic extension with default features
const extension = defineBasicExtension()

// Create an editor with the extension
const editor = createEditor({ extension })
```

The basic extension includes the most commonly used extensions. Please refer to the [API reference](/references/basic/#define-basic-extension) for a complete list of included extensions.

## Adding specific extensions

To customize your editor with exactly the features you need, you can combine individual extensions:

```ts
import {
  defineBaseCommands,
  defineBaseKeymap,
  defineDoc,
  defineHistory,
  defineParagraph,
  defineText,
  union,
} from '@prosekit/core'
import {
  createEditor,
  defineExtension,
} from 'prosekit/core'
import { defineBold } from 'prosekit/extensions/bold'
import { defineHeading } from 'prosekit/extensions/heading'

function defineMyExtension() {
  return union([
    defineDoc(),
    defineHistory(),
    defineParagraph(),
    defineText(),
    defineBold(),
    defineHeading(),
  ])
}

const extension = defineMyExtension()

const editor = createEditor({ extension })
```
