ProseKit provides a headless editor framework that gives you complete control over your editor's appearance. This guide will walk you through the various ways to style your ProseKit editor.

## Basic Styles

ProseKit requires some basic styles to function properly. Import the `prosekit/basic/style.css` file in your project.

```ts
// Import the basic styles (required)
import 'prosekit/basic/style.css'
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Always include the core styles from `prosekit/basic/style.css` in your project. Without these styles, your editor may not behave correctly.
</Aside>

## Typography Styles

ProseKit provides an optional set of typography styles that make your editor content look polished with minimal effort.

The `typography.css` file provides a beautiful set of default styles for headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements:

```ts
// Import both basic and typography styles
import 'prosekit/basic/style.css'
import 'prosekit/basic/typography.css'
```

Here's what the default typography looks like:

<Demo story="typography" showCode={false} />

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

ProseKit provides a set of components that you can copy and paste into your project. These components are styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), allowing you to create beautiful, responsive editors with minimal effort.

<Steps>

1. **Install Tailwind CSS**

   If you haven't already, set up Tailwind CSS in your project:

   <CodeGroupInstallation packages="tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer" />

   For detailed installation instructions, see the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

2. **Install recommended plugins**

   For the best experience with ProseKit components, install these Tailwind CSS plugins:

   <CodeGroupInstallation packages="tailwindcss-animate @egoist/tailwindcss-icons @iconify-json/lucide" />

3. **Configure Tailwind CSS**

   Update your Tailwind CSS configuration:

   ```js
   // tailwind.config.js
   import { iconsPlugin } from '@egoist/tailwindcss-icons'
   import animatePlugin from 'tailwindcss-animate'

   export default {
     content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue,svelte}'],
     plugins: [iconsPlugin(), animatePlugin],
   }
   ```

4. **That's it**

   You can now start adding [components](/components/toolbar) to your project.
