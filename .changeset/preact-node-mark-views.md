Add complete Preact support with node/mark views and useEditorDerivedValue hook. Preact now has feature parity with React, including:

- `definePreactNodeView` for custom node views
- `definePreactMarkView` for custom mark views
- `useEditorDerivedValue` hook for reactive state derivation
- Integration with ProsemirrorAdapterProvider for full adapter support
