This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your first ProseKit editor. We'll create a basic editor with some common formatting options.

Using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)? You can install a full-featured example even faster:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @prosekit/react-example-full
```

## Installation

First, you'll need to install the `prosekit` package. You can use your preferred package manager:

<CodePackageManagers packages="prosekit" />

## A minimal editor

Now, let's create a basic editor component. Open your project and add a component file, then replace its content with the following code based on your UI framework:

<Demo story="minimal" />

This code does the following:

1. Creates `extension` by calling `defineBasicExtension()`. This extension provides basic text editing features like paragraphs, headings, bold, italic, etc.
2. Creates `editor` by calling `createEditor()`. The extension created in the previous step is passed to the editor.
3. Creates a `<ProseKit>` component. This component acts as a provider for the children and doesn't render anything to the DOM directly.
4. Creates a `<div>` element that mounts the editor. The `editor.mount()` method is used to attach the editor to this `<div>` element.
