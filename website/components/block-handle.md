<!-- @include: @/example-code-blocks/block-handle/block-handle.md -->

## Usage

Add the `BlockHandle` component to your `Editor` component.

The `BlockHandle` consists of three parts:

- `BlockHandlePopover`: A popover that appears on the left side of a block when you hover over it.
- `BlockHandleAdd`: A button that lets you insert a new block below the one you're hovering over.
- `BlockHandleDraggable`: A draggable component that allows to reorder a block.

You can choose to use either `BlockHandleAdd`, `BlockHandleDraggable`, or both components together.
