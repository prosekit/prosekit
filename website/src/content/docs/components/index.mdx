ProseKit provides a set of components that you can copy and paste into your project. These components are styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), allowing you to create beautiful, responsive editors with minimal effort.

## Installation

<Steps>

1. **Install Tailwind CSS**

   If you haven't already, set up Tailwind CSS in your project. See the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for instructions.

2. **Install recommended plugins**

   You’ll need a few extra packages for these components to work properly. Install the following:

   <CodePackageManagers packages="tw-animate-css @egoist/tailwindcss-icons @iconify-json/lucide" />

3. **Configure Tailwind CSS**

   Add this to your global CSS file (e.g., `global.css` or `app.css`):

   ```css
   @import "tw-animate-css";
   @plugin "@egoist/tailwindcss-icons";
   ```

4. **That's it**

   You can now start adding components to your project.
