## Functions

### keymap() {#keymap}

<dl>

<dt>

<code data-typedoc-code><i>function</i> <a id="keymap" href="#keymap">keymap</a>(`bindings`: `object`): [`ProseMirrorPlugin`](state.md#prosemirrorplugin)</code>

</dt>

<dd>

Create a keymap plugin for the given set of bindings.

Bindings should map key names to [command](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands)-style
functions, which will be called with `(EditorState, dispatch,
EditorView)` arguments, and should return true when they've handled
the key. Note that the view argument isn't part of the command
protocol, but can be used as an escape hatch if a binding needs to
directly interact with the UI.

Key names may be strings like `"Shift-Ctrl-Enter"`â€”a key
identifier prefixed with zero or more modifiers. Key identifiers
are based on the strings that can appear in
[`KeyEvent.key`](https:developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key).
Use lowercase letters to refer to letter keys (or uppercase letters
if you want shift to be held). You may use `"Space"` as an alias
for the `" "` name.

Modifiers can be given in any order. `Shift-` (or `s-`), `Alt-` (or
`a-`), `Ctrl-` (or `c-` or `Control-`) and `Cmd-` (or `m-` or
`Meta-`) are recognized. For characters that are created by holding
shift, the `Shift-` prefix is implied, and should not be added
explicitly.

You can use `Mod-` as a shorthand for `Cmd-` on Mac and `Ctrl-` on
other platforms.

You can add multiple keymap plugins to an editor. The order in
which they appear determines their precedence (the ones early in
the array get to dispatch first).

### keydownHandler() {#keydownhandler}

<dl>

<dt>

<code data-typedoc-code><i>function</i> <a id="keydownhandler" href="#keydownhandler">keydownHandler</a>(`bindings`: `object`): (`view`: [`EditorView`](view.md#editorview), `event`: [`KeyboardEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent)) => `boolean`</code>

</dt>

<dd>

Given a set of bindings (using the same format as
[`keymap`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#keymap.keymap)), return a [keydown
handler](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.EditorProps.handleKeyDown) that handles them.
