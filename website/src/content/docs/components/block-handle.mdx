<Demo story="block-handle" />

## Installation

Copy and paste the component source files linked above into your project.

The `BlockHandle` consists of three parts:

- `BlockHandlePopover`: A popover that appears on the left side of a block when you hover over it.
- `BlockHandleAdd`: A button that lets you insert a new block below the one you're hovering over.
- `BlockHandleDraggable`: A draggable component that allows to reorder a block.

You can choose to use either `BlockHandleAdd`, `BlockHandleDraggable`, or both components together.
