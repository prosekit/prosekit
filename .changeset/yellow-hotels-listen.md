Add new components:

- `BlockHandlePopover`: A popover that appears on the left side of a block when you hover over it.
- `BlockHandleAdd`: A button that lets you insert a new block below the one you're hovering over.
- `BlockHandleDraggable`: A draggable component that allows to reorder a block.

Deprecate `BlockPopover` and `BlockDragHandle`.
