ProseKit is an unstyled editor that allows you to fully customize its appearance. However, ProseKit does provide several out-of-the-box styling options. Specifically, ProseKit offers styles at three different levels:

## Use `style.css`

`prosekit/basic/style.css` is the basic and most important stylesheet. Make sure you load this file so that ProseKit can work properly.

```ts {2}
// index.ts
import 'prosekit/basic/style.css'
```

## Use `typography.css`

`prosekit/basic/typography.css` provides a beautiful set of typographic styles. This stylesheet gives you attractive text formatting, such as font sizes and margins for `<p>`, `<h1>` elements.

You can import `prosekit/basic/typography.css` as a quick start:

```ts {3}
// index.ts
import 'prosekit/basic/style.css'
import 'prosekit/basic/typography.css'
```

Alternatively, you can copy all the content of this file (which can be found [here](https://unpkg.com/prosekit/dist/basic/typography.css)) and customize it according to your needs.

## Setting Up Tailwind CSS

ProseKit offers a library of styleless components. You can view all components [here(TODO)](HTTPS://example.com/THIS_WEBSITE_LINK_IS_NOT_READY_YET/PLEASE_FILL_ME_LATER). For each component, we provide examples based on TailwindCSS. You can directly copy our examples into your project that has TailwindCSS configured. Check [this page(TODO)](https://example.com/THIS_WEBSITE_LINK_IS_NOT_READY_YET/PLEASE_FILL_ME_LATER) to learn how to configure TailwindCSS.

<Steps>

1. **Install and configure Tailwind CSS**

   Please refer to the official documentation: https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

2. **Install dependencies**

   <CodeGroupInstallation packages="tailwindcss-animate @egoist/tailwindcss-icons @iconify-json/lucide" />

3. **Modify the configuration file**

   ```js {2-3,7}
   // tailwind.config.js
   import { iconsPlugin } from '@egoist/tailwindcss-icons'
   import animatePlugin from 'tailwindcss-animate'

   export default {
     content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue,svelte}'],
     plugins: [iconsPlugin(), animatePlugin],
   }
   ```

4. **That's it**

   You can now start adding components to your project.
