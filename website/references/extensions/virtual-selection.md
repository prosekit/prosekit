## defineVirtualSelection {#define-virtual-selection}

```ts
function defineVirtualSelection(): VirtualSelectionExtension
```

Shows a virtual selection when the editor is not focused. When the editor is
not focused, the selected inline content will be wrapped in a `<span>`
element with the class `prosekit-virtual-selection`.

This is useful when you want to move the focus to an element outside the
editor, but still want to show the selection.
