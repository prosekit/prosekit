`defineCodeBlockShiki()` now sets two CSS variables:

- `--prosemirror-highlight`: sets text color
- `--prosemirror-highlight-bg`: sets background color

These colors are based on the Shiki theme you pass to `defineCodeBlockShiki()`.

The typography styles in `prosekit/basic/typography.css` is also updated to use
these CSS variables to set the text color and background color of code blocks.
