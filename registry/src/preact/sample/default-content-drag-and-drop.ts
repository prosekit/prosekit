<p>Try dragging any paragraph or heading by clicking on the handle that appears on the left when you hover over it.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Ordered lists also support dragging</li>

<h3>Code Blocks</h3>

<p>Even code blocks can be moved:</p>

function dragAndDrop() {
  return "Easy to rearrange!"
}</code></pre>

<h2>Nested Content</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This blockquote can be moved as a single unit.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Nested blockquotes move together with their parent.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>

<p>Practice by moving this paragraph to the top of the document.</p>
