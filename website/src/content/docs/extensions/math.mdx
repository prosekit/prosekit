:::caution
This feature has not been released yet. To use it now, install the pre-release version:

```sh
npm i https://pkg.pr.new/prosekit/prosekit@1449
```

:::

The `math` extension adds support for mathematical equations in your document, including both inline math and block-level math expressions. It is renderer agnostic, allowing you to use any math rendering library such as [KaTeX] or [Temml].

<Demo story="katex" />

## Usage

```ts twoslash
import { defineMath } from 'prosekit/extensions/math'

const extension = defineMath({
  renderMathInline: (code: string, element: HTMLElement) => {
    // Render inline math into the given <span> element
  },
  renderMathBlock: (code: string, element: HTMLElement) => {
    // Render block math into the given <div> element
  },
})
```

## Keyboard Interaction

Type `$...$` to create an inline math expression.

Type `$$` on an empty line and press `Enter` to create a block-level math expression.
