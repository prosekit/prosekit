Add `<DropIndicator />` component to replace `defineDropCursor` extension.

The new `<DropIndicator />` component provides improved drag-and-drop visual feedback when dragging content into the editor. This replaces the previous `defineDropCursor` extension that was based on the [`prosemirror-dropcursor`](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-dropcursor) package. The component offers more accurate positioning for nested lists, better support for customization and animations.
