ProseKit provides a headless editor framework that gives you complete control over your editor's appearance. This guide will walk you through the various ways to style your ProseKit editor.

## Basic Styles

ProseKit requires some basic styles to function properly. Import `prosekit/basic/style.css` in your project to include these styles.

```ts twoslash
// Import the basic styles (required)
import 'prosekit/basic/style.css'
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Always include the core styles from `prosekit/basic/style.css` in your project. Without these styles, your editor may not behave correctly.
</Aside>

## Typography Styles

ProseKit provides an optional set of typography styles that make your editor content look polished with minimal effort.

`prosekit/basic/typography.css` provides a beautiful set of default styles for headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements:

```ts twoslash
// Import both basic and typography styles
import 'prosekit/basic/style.css'
import 'prosekit/basic/typography.css'
```

Here's what the default typography looks like:

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

ProseKit works well with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling your editor. For pre-built editor components that use Tailwind CSS, see the [Components](/components/) documentation.
